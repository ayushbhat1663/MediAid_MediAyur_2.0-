MediAid & MediAyur – AI Powered Healthcare Assistance Platform
Project Overview

MediAid & MediAyur is a dual-module web-based healthcare assistance platform designed to provide users with quick access to medical guidance, medicine purchasing, hospital location services, and voice-based AI consultation.

MediAid focuses on modern medical assistance using AI-based chatbots and voice interaction to provide instant health guidance.
MediAyur focuses on Ayurvedic and natural healthcare solutions, offering holistic remedies and wellness guidance.

The system integrates both platforms into a unified portal, making healthcare information easily accessible, especially for elderly users, rural populations, and non-technical users.

The project demonstrates real-world web development practices including modular frontend architecture, simulated backend services, API integration, responsive UI design, and scalable system planning. Although the system currently operates primarily on the client side, it has been architected to support backend and database expansion in future phases.
